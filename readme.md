Weather Forecast for Different City on Japan

## Why I think my UI and UX are the best

I used a template color that is related/traditional to the Japan not just a typical blue/green theme or a travel site.

And I did some design that I personally what Japan is.

Also, I make sure that my design is mobile friendly.
